National Parks Information App

This app will prompt you to select parks by state and give you
information about the activities available at each park.

To run the app:

streamlit run main.py

Current goals:

- User selects state from dropdown
- Table comes up which shows all the states and activities, user selects set of parks
- Image tiles come up in grid showing random images from parks below
- (maybe) User clicks on an a tile and it takes you the park home page.

This app was built as an exercise to learn Streamlit and practice some of techniques laid out in the ArjanCodes Next-level Python course. Thanks also to the US National Parks Service for providing a free API.
